| Oct 15th | 11:00am - 11:45am | I started by writing a program that would solve this problem in linear time (not efficient), but a good starting place. I had first thought that the goal of the program set was to return how many SRT matches there were in the sequence and not how many consecutive. The idea of the problem set makes really good sense to me now! |
| Oct 15th | 11:45am - 12:30pm | I wrote all of the code that I thought was needed to solve the problem, but I still kept on getting out of bounds errors. I used the debugger to go threw my code and find out what was going on. I found that my indexes on what I was comparing were not equal at some points. |
| Oct 15th |  3:45pm - 4:30pm  | I used the debugger again to try and find my source of errors. I kept on changing the code and would get errors of either out of bounds or a program that returned 0 for all test cases. I figured out that I needed to update j if there a sequence match. |
| Oct 15th |  4:30pm - 5:15pm  | During this time I finally fixed my errors regarding the current index. The first three tests cases are passed, and I stopped the large test file at roughly 35 minutes in, because it will probably take a very long time. It's always interesting to start with code that's not efficient and then turn it into something that takes less than 1 second. |
| Oct 22th |  1:00pm - 1:45pm  | Deleted my V1 code as it wasn't efficient. Starting implementing horner's method from the pseudocode on the slides. The idea of the problem set makes perfect sense and I just need to code it! |
| Oct 24th | 12:35pm - 1:45pm  | I had an amazing meeting with Mr. Blick where he helped truly understand the scale of the problem (I had thought it was easier than it actually was). We worked through each part of the problem on the whiteboard which was super useful (need to continue doing that). Everything works besides the big test which means that my end check isn't working. |
| Oct 24th |  5:45pm - 6:30pm  | I figured out that the reason why the largest test case was giving me an answer 1 less than expected was because I wasn't checking the last letter of the last sequence. All of the test cases are passed now and have a fast run time. I also added comments that explain my code! |
